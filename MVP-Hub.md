# **MVP - Hub**

## **Description**

MotiaHub is the GitHub for Motia workflows. It provides a centralized platform for hosting, monitoring, deploying, and scaling workflows with advanced observability and security features.

## **Key Features**

### **Access and Permissions**

- Multi-user access with role-based permissions.

### **Deployment and Versioning**

- **Environment Management**:
  - Define and manage upstream environments (e.g., staging, production).
  - One-line deployments with automatic CI/CD integration (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- **Version Control**:
  - Visualize all workflow versions in the Hub UI.
  - Control traffic allocation between versions (e.g., 25% traffic to `v1`, 75% to `v2` for testing).
  - Rollback to previous versions if needed.

### **Observability and Debugging**

- **Metrics and Logging**:
  - View real-time metrics, including event throughput, execution times, and error rates.
  - Logs available for each flow and step, with filtering by version, environment, and trace ID.
- **Tracing**:
  - End-to-end traceability of flow executions, including inputs, outputs, and triggered events.

### **Testing and Evaluation**

- **Data Sampling**:
  - Add specific runs as datasets for testing and evaluation.
  - Compare metrics and outputs across different versions or environments.
- **CLI Integration**:
  - Authenticate with the Hub via CLI to fetch datasets and run workflows locally for regression testing.

## **Security and Compliance**

- **Data Integrity**:
  - Messages are encrypted in transit and at rest.
  - Prevent cross-pollination or unintended exposure of messages between workflows.
- **Authentication**:
  - Support for OIDC and custom authentication providers.
  - Per-environment access controls for APIs and workflows.
- **Auditing**:
  - Full audit logs for changes, deployments, and flow executions.

## **Additional Ideas**

1. **Workflow Marketplace**:

   - Allow users to share and discover pre-built workflows.
   - Enable developers to monetize their workflows via paid licenses or subscriptions.

2. **Workflow Orchestration Features**:

   - Advanced scheduling options (e.g., dependent flows, conditional triggers).
   - Dynamic scaling of flows based on demand.

3. **Collaboration**:

   - Integrated code review and approval workflows for production changes.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:

   - Set up alerts for anomalies (e.g., increased error rates, latency spikes).
   - Integration with tools like Slack, PagerDuty, or Microsoft Teams for real-time notifications.

5. **Custom UI Dashboards**:

   - Allow users to build custom dashboards to display metrics and logs relevant to their workflows.
