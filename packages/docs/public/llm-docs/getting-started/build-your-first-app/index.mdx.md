Welcome to the **Build Your First Motia App** tutorial series! This comprehensive guide will take you from zero to building production-ready applications with Motia's powerful step-based architecture.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

Through this hands-on tutorial series, you'll master the fundamental building blocks of Motia applications:

- **API Endpoints** - Create REST APIs with full CRUD operations, request validation, and response handling
- **Background Jobs** - Build event-driven workflows and scheduled tasks (coming soon)
- **Real-time Features** - Add WebSocket connections and live data streaming (coming soon)
- **Multi-language Integration** - Combine TypeScript, Python, and JavaScript in one application (coming soon)

## ðŸ“š Tutorial Structure

Each tutorial in this series builds upon the previous one, giving you a complete understanding of Motia's capabilities:

### 1. API Endpoints âœ…

**[Creating Your First REST API](/docs/getting-started/build-your-first-app/creating-your-first-rest-api)**

Learn the fundamentals of building REST APIs in Motia. You'll create a complete pet store API with:
- **POST /pets** - Create new pets with validation
- **GET /pets** - List all pets  
- **GET /pets/:id** - Get specific pets by ID
- **PUT /pets/:id** - Update existing pets
- **DELETE /pets/:id** - Remove pets

Perfect for understanding API steps, request/response handling, and Motia's type-safe approach.

### 2. Background Jobs (Coming Soon)

Learn how to add automated background processing to your APIs:
- Event-triggered jobs when data changes
- Scheduled cron jobs for recurring tasks  
- Email notifications and external integrations
- Queue management and error handling

### 3. Real-time Features (Coming Soon)

Add live data streaming and WebSocket connections:
- Real-time notifications to clients
- Live data synchronization across users
- Chat features and collaborative tools
- Event-driven UI updates

### 4. Advanced Integrations (Coming Soon)

Build complex multi-service applications:
- External API integrations
- Database connections and migrations
- Authentication and authorization
- Deployment and monitoring
