# Vision

Wistro.js aims to simplify the creation and scaling of event-driven flows by:

- Providing a **core framework** for defining flows as collections of testable components.
- Supporting **real-time event handling** with loose coupling between components.
- Offering tools for **UI-based flow visualization**.
- Enabling seamless **integration with external APIs** like Google Drive and OpenAI.

## Aspirational Vision

Wistro.js strives to be:

- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy to adopt and extend.
- **Production-Ready**: Scales gracefully from prototypes to enterprise-grade flows.
- **Integration-First**: Works seamlessly with third-party tools and services.
