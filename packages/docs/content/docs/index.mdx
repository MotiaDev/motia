Motia is a powerful framework for building event-driven applications. It provides simple, composable building blocks called **Steps** that handle your business logic while Motia manages the infrastructure.

## Installation

Create a new **Motia** project using the default template

```bash
npx motia create -t default
```

or add **Motia** into an existing project

```package-install
motia @motiadev/core @motiadev/workbench
```

## Why Motia?

- 🚀 **Zero Infrastructure Setup** - No message queues or event brokers to configure
- 🔌 **Plug-and-Play Steps** - Write code in your favorite language (JS, TS, Python, Ruby)
- 📊 **Built-in Observability** - Real-time logs, traces, and flow visualization
- ⚡ **Built-in API & Scheduling** - Out of the box support for HTTP endpoints and scheduled tasks

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Steps** | Self-contained units of logic that process events |
| **Flows** | Logical groupings of related steps |
| **Events** | Messages passed between steps |
| **Topics** | Named channels for event routing |
