Motia provides built-in testing capabilities using Jest to ensure your workflows are reliable and maintainable. We've made it really easy to write tests for your steps and flows. 

Whether you’re testing a single step, an entire flow, or state-dependent behavior, the built-in testing utilities let you simulate real executions and ensure your logic works as expected.

Motia uses `Jest` as its testing framework, so you can write tests for Motia apps using Jest's syntax.

### Step Testing

Step testing allows you to test your step handlers in isolation to ensure they behave correctly for different inputs. 

You test just one step at a time, by directly calling the handler function and passing a mock context with things like `emit`, `logger`, `state`, etc.

To test a step, create a test file with the same name as the step file, but with a `.test.ts` or `.test.js` extension. For example, if your step file is named `my-step.step.ts`, create a test file named `my-step.step.test.ts`.

Here's an example:


```typescript
// my-step.step.test.ts

// Import test utilities from Motia
import { createTestContext } from '@motiadev/testing'
import { handler } from './my-step.step'

// Describe the step you’re testing
describe('MyStep', () => {
  it('should emit an event with the correct data', async () => {

    // Create a mock context with emit and done functions
    const { emit, done } = createTestContext()

    // Call the handler with test input and the mock context
    await handler({ name: 'John' }, { emit })

    // Assert that the step emitted the correct event with expected data
    expect(emit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      type: 'my-event',
      data: { greeting: 'Hello, John!' },
    })

    // Mark the test as done
    done()
  })
})
```

### Flow Testing

You simulate an entire flow end-to-end using `createTestFlow()`, chaining together multiple steps. Flow testing allows you to test complete workflows to ensure steps work together correctly.

Just like with Step testing, to test a flow, create a test file with the flow name and a `.test.ts` or `.test.js` extension. For example, if your flow is named `my-flow`, create a test file named `my-flow.test.ts`.

```typescript
// my-flow.test.ts

// Import test utilities and step handlers
import { createTestFlow } from '@motiadev/testing'
import { handler as stepAHandler } from './step-a.step'
import { handler as stepBHandler } from './step-b.step'

describe('MyFlow', () => {
  it('should execute steps in the correct order', async () => {

    // Create a test flow and register step handlers in sequence
    const flow = createTestFlow('my-flow')
      .step('step-a', stepAHandler)
      .step('step-b', stepBHandler)

    // Execute the flow with sample input
    const result = await flow.execute({ name: 'Alice' })

    // Assert that the final result from the flow matches expectations
    expect(result).toEqual({
      greeting: 'Hello, Alice!',
      message: 'Welcome to Motia!',
    })
  })
})
```

### Running Tests

Run your test locally with these commands:

<Tabs items={['All Tests', 'Watch Mode']}>
<Tab value="All Tests">
```bash
pnpm test
```

Runs all test files in your project and displays results.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Watch Mode">
```bash
pnpm test --watch
```

Automatically re-runs tests when you make changes to your code.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Test Organization

A well-structured test layout mirrors your project structure. This keeps your codebase easy to navigate and makes it obvious where each test lives. 

We recommend colocating tests alongside the corresponding steps and flows, so they stay close to the logic they verify.

```
my-motia-project/
├── steps/
│   ├── process-order.step.ts
│   ├── process-order.step.test.ts
│   ├── validate-payment.step.ts
│   └── validate-payment.step.test.ts
├── flows/
│   ├── order-processing.flow.ts
│   └── order-processing.flow.test.ts
└── package.json
```

**Pro Tip**: Use structured logging consistently across your application to enable powerful log analysis and monitoring in production environments. Make sure you've read how to [use logging](/docs/foundations/logging) in Motia apps.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Test Every Step and Flow</strong><br/>Ensure each individual step and full workflow has dedicated test coverage to catch issues early.</li>
  <li><strong>Write Descriptive Test Cases</strong><br/>Use clear, meaningful names for test cases so others (or future you) understand their intent at a glance.</li>
  <li><strong>Cover Edge Cases and Failures</strong><br/>Don’t just test the happy path—simulate invalid inputs, timeouts, and failures to verify robust handling.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep Tests Focused and Independent</strong><br/>Each test should validate a single behavior without relying on other tests or shared state.</li>
  <li><strong>Mock External Dependencies</strong><br/>Use mocks or stubs for API calls, databases, or services to keep tests fast, reliable, and isolated.</li>

## Next Steps
Writing tests is more than just checking if code works. It's about building confidence in your workflows. 

This section outlines practical testing habits that help you catch edge cases early, isolate failures, and maintain reliability as your Motia project grows.
