title: Flows & Visualization

**Flows** let you group multiple **steps** under a single name, making it easier to visually map out how events move across your application. While flows are technically optional, they're invaluable for:

- **Clarity**: Understand how **steps** interact with each other at a glance
- **Visualization**: Get a visual representation of event flow across your **steps**
- **Observability**: Group logs and events by flow name for easier debugging

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Tagging Steps with a Flow

  To associate Steps with a flow, add a `flows` field to your Step config. For example:

  ```js
  // addNumbers.step.js
  exports.config = {
    type: 'event',
    name: 'AddNumbers',
    subscribes: ['add-numbers'],
    emits: ['numbers-added'],
    flows: ['demo-flow'], // <-- Assign it to a flow
  }

  // ... handler definition
  ```

  ```js
  // exampleApi.step.js
  exports.config = {
    type: 'api',
    name: 'AddNumbersApi',
    path: '/api/add',
    method: 'POST',
    emits: ['add-numbers'],
    flows: ['demo-flow'], // <-- Same flow name
  }

  // ... handler definition
  ```

  <Callout>You can associate a **step** with multiple flows by providing an array of flow names, for example: `['billing-flow', 'analytics-flow']`</Callout>

  ### Visualizing Your Flows

  <Steps>
    <Step>
      Start your development server:

      <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm', 'bun']}>
        <Tab value='pnpm'>
        ```bash
        pnpm run dev
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value='yarn'>
        ```bash
        yarn run dev
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value='npm'>
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value='bun'>
        ```bash
        bun run dev
        ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      [Open](http://localhost:3000) Motia Workbench in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000`).
    </Step>
    <Step>
      **Navigate** to your flow name on the left sidebar and click it. You'll see a visual graph where each **step** is represented as a node, with connecting lines showing event flow patterns.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      **Click** on any **step** node to inspect its configuration details, including name, emits, subscribes, and other properties.
    </Step>
  </Steps>

    ### Flow Diagram Basics

    Motia Workbench visualizes your application as an interactive node graph:

    - **Steps** are displayed as nodes that subscribe to and emit events
    - **Edges** (connecting lines) show event flow between steps
    - The top-right corner contains a legend - hover over any item to highlight corresponding step types or edge types in the diagram
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Flow-Specific Logs

    In your terminal (or in the logs panel of **Motia Workbench**), all event activities performed by **steps** are logged and grouped by `traceId`. This makes it easy to trace and debug event flows through your application.
