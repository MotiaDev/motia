import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## Quick Setup

When you create a new Motia project, the AI development guides are automatically included:

```bash
npx motia@latest create 
cd <your-project>
```

Your project now has AI development guides in `.cursor/rules/` that work with all major AI coding tools.

## What's Included

Complete guides with **TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python** examples for:
- API Steps, Event Steps, Cron Steps
- State Management, Middleware, Real-time Streaming
- Virtual Steps, UI Steps
- Architecture & Error Handling

## Supported AI Tools

### Works Out of the Box

- **Cursor IDE** - Reads `.cursor/rules/` directly
- **Claude Code** - Uses pre-configured subagents in `.claude/agents/`
- **OpenCode, Codex** - Via `AGENTS.md`
- **Aider, Jules, Factory, Amp, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI** - Via [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) standard

### Coming Soon

- **Windsurf, Cline**

## Usage

Just start coding - your AI tool will automatically read the guides and follow Motia patterns.

**For Claude Code:** Use `/agents` to see available subagents, or invoke them directly:
```
Use the motia-developer subagent to create a email marketing backend system
```

## Update Guides

```bash
npx motia rules pull          # Update to latest
npx motia rules pull --force  # Overwrite existing
```

## Best Practices

1. Commit `.cursor/`, `AGENTS.md`, and config files to Git
2. Run `npx motia rules pull` after upgrading Motia
3. Customize guides for project-specific needs
