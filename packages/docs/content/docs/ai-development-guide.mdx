## Quick Setup

When you create a new Motia project, the Cursor Rules are automatically included:

```bash
# Create new Motia project with Cursor Rules included
npx motia@latest create 
cd <your-project>
```

The Cursor rules will be automatically placed in `.cursor/rules/` directory in your project.

## What's Included

The Cursor Rules include patterns for:
- **API Steps**: Creating HTTP endpoints
- **Event Steps**: Background task processing
- **Cron Steps**: Scheduled tasks
- **State Management**: Managing state across steps
- **Middleware**: Request/response processing
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket and SSE patterns
- **Virtual Steps**: Visual flow connections in Workbench

## Using the Guides

If you're using Cursor IDE, the rules are automatically detected and used by the AI assistant. Simply start coding and the AI will follow Motia's patterns.

<Callout type="info">
You can view the AI guides source code at [github.com/MotiaDev/motia/tree/main/packages/snap/src/cursor-rules/dot-files/.cursor](https://github.com/MotiaDev/motia/tree/main/packages/snap/src/cursor-rules/dot-files/.cursor)

## Other AI Coding Tools

<Callout type="warning">
We're currently working on guides for other AI coding tools like Codex, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Claude Code, Windsurf, and others. These will be added shortly.

For now, Cursor IDE users will get the best AI-assisted development experience with Motia.
