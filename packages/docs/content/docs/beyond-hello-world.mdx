You’ve built your first Motia step and seen it in action. What next? 

This page gives you a bird’s-eye view of what’s possible with Motia, and where to go for more.

Motia is more than just steps. It's a way to write unified backends, for orchestrating APIs, automations, and AI logic, built for how modern software is written today.

Following is an architectural overview of how Motia apps work:

## Steps: The Building Blocks

Everything in Motia is a **Step**. Steps are isolated units of logic that receive input, do work, and emit output.

_Everything in a Motia app is a Step._

Steps make your backend modular, testable, and easy to visualize and reason about.

## State: Share and Persist Data

Steps can store and share data across a flow using Motia’s built-in **state manager**.

Whether you're passing data between steps or persisting temporary results, the built-in state manager helps you do it cleanly and effectively.

Think of it as a persistent memory that follows your workflow execution from start to finish.

States enable you to cleanly decouple logic. One step writes something, another reads it.  
_No messy globals._

## Streams: Real-time Data Flow, without Polling

Steps can stream updates in real time from your backend to your frontend (or other consumers).

With streams, users can see progress as it happens, without needing to refresh or the app constantly checking for changes, or making users wait for the entire response.

## Workbench: Motia's visual utility
Motia Workbench is your all-in-one development utility. Think of it as the mission control for your workflows.

From here, you can:

- Test API endpoints
- Visualize flows and step connections
- Inspect inputs, outputs, logs, state, and streams

## Motia CLI

The `motia` package ships with the Motia CLI out of the box.

Motia CLI allows you to:

- Scaffold new steps
- Preview flows and endpoints
- Deploy and manage environments

With Motia CLI, you get to focus on logic. _Motia takes care of the plumbing._

## Deploying Motia Apps: Local to Production

Motia makes it simple to go from local development to production (or any other environment).

Once your logic is ready and tested, you can:

- Use Motia CLI to deploy to any environment you choose on the Motia Cloud, and
- Monitor real-time logs and step results in production

_Motia Cloud designed for predictable deployments and easy maintenance._
