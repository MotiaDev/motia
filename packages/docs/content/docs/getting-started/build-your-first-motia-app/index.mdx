title: Build Your First Motia App
description: Learn Motia step-by-step by building a real pet store backend
---

## What You'll Build

A complete pet store backend system that grows with you:

- **API Endpoints** → Handle requests, return responses
- **Background Jobs** → Process tasks without blocking APIs
- **Workflows** → Coordinate complex business logic automatically
- **AI Agents** → Make intelligent decisions that drive your workflows
- **Real-Time Streaming** → Push live updates to clients as workflows execute

By the end, you'll have a production-ready backend that handles everything from simple CRUD to intelligent, real-time systems.

## How This Works

These tutorials build on each other. Each one adds a new layer to your pet store:

**Start Simple** → You'll create basic API endpoints to manage pets. Create, read, update, delete. The fundamentals.

**Go Async** → Next, you'll add background jobs that run without blocking your APIs. When a pet is created, set up feeding reminders. When pets are deleted, clean them up on a schedule.

**Add Orchestration** → Then you'll build workflows that manage the pet lifecycle automatically. New pets go through quarantine, health checks, and become available for adoption - all coordinated by your workflow.

**Get Intelligent** → Then you'll add AI agents that make decisions. Should this pet get treatment? Is this profile ready for adopters? Let AI handle the judgment calls.

**Go Real-Time** → Finally, you'll add streaming to push live updates. As workflows execute in the background, clients get real-time feedback on what's happening.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most tutorials show you disconnected examples. This one builds a real system from the ground up.

Each guide picks up where the last one ended. You'll see how the pieces fit together, not just how they work in isolation.

And you'll use **Workbench** - Motia's visual dev tool - to watch everything happen in real-time. See your flows, test your APIs, read your logs, all in one place.

---

## Before You Start

You'll need:
- Node.js installed (v18 or higher)
- Basic understanding of TypeScript/JavaScript/Python
- 10-20 minutes per tutorial

That's it. No database setup, no complex config, no separate services to run.

## Your Journey

### 1. API Endpoints

**What:** Create HTTP endpoints that handle pet operations.

**You'll learn:**
- How to define API Steps
- Request validation with schemas
- Returning proper HTTP responses
- Testing endpoints in Workbench

**Time:** 10 minutes

</Card>

---

### 2. Background Jobs

**What:** Add async tasks that run without blocking your APIs.

**You'll learn:**
- Event Steps that trigger from your APIs
- Cron Steps that run on a schedule
- How events connect your system
- Monitoring jobs in Workbench

**Time:** 15 minutes

</Card>

---

### 3. Workflows

**What:** Coordinate complex processes with automatic transitions and validation.

**You'll learn:**
- Building workflow orchestrators
- Automatic vs manual transitions
- State validation and progression
- Chaining multiple actions together

**Time:** 20 minutes

### 4. AI Agents

**What:** Add intelligent decision-making to your workflows.

**You'll learn:**
- Content generation with AI
- Decision-making agents
- Integrating AI with workflows
- Building agentic routing

**Time:** 20 minutes

</Card>

---

### 5. Real-Time Streaming

**What:** Push live updates to clients while your workflows run in the background.

**You'll learn:**
- Defining stream configurations
- Streaming from APIs that return immediately
- Background jobs that push progress updates
- AI agents that stream enrichment progress
- Connecting multiple steps to the same stream

**Time:** 20 minutes

## The Example Project

All tutorials use the same project - a pet store backend that handles:

- **Pet management** → Create, update, list pets
- **Adoption workflow** → Guide pets through quarantine, health checks, and availability
- **Feeding reminders** → Set up schedules when pets arrive
- **Health decisions** → AI evaluates symptoms and recommends treatment
- **Cleanup jobs** → Remove soft-deleted pets on a schedule
- **Real-time updates** → Stream progress to clients as workflows execute

This isn't a toy example. It's a real system with the kind of complexity you'll face building production backends.

---

## Interactive Tutorials

![interactive-tutorial](../../img/build-your-first-app/interactive-tutorial-streaming.png)

Each guide includes an **interactive tutorial** you can run directly in Workbench. It walks you through the code, explains what's happening, and lets you test everything live.

Prefer reading? The written guides cover everything too. They're detailed, with code examples and explanations for every concept.

---

## What You'll Know After

By the time you finish all five tutorials, you'll understand:

- How to structure a Motia backend
- When to use APIs vs background jobs vs workflows
- How to let Steps communicate through events
- How to build orchestrators that coordinate complex logic
- How to add AI that makes intelligent decisions
- How to push real-time updates to clients with streams
- How to test and debug everything in Workbench

Most importantly, you'll have built a complete system from scratch. Not read about it. Actually built it.

## Ready?

Pick your starting point. If you're new to Motia, start with API Endpoints. If you've already covered the basics, jump to wherever you want to learn more.
