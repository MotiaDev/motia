title: Build Your First API in Motia (TypeScript)
description: Learn how to create, connect, and extend your first API using Motia’s workflow engine in TypeScript. This guide covers key concepts, best practices, and how APIs fit into Motia’s polyglot architecture.
---

APIs are one of the core concepts of Motia because they define how your backend talks to external applications. In Motia, creating an API is just one kind of Step you can add to your workflow, but it’s a powerful starting point because you can immediately connect it to other Steps, events, and services without extra setup.

This guide will walk you through the concepts behind building your first API in Motia using TypeScript. You’ll learn what an API Step is, how requests are handled inside Motia, and how to connect your API to other parts of your backend.

If you prefer to jump straight into coding, we’ve got you covered with the interactive tutorial (a placeholder can be placed here) where you’ll build the API hands-on. Here, we’ll focus on the bigger picture:

1. Why API Steps work the way they do
2. How they interact with Flows, State, and Events
3. Tips and best practices

## Motia Concepts You’ll Use

Before we dive into building your first API, let’s get familiar with the core concepts you’ll work with in Motia:

- **Step** – The smallest unit of logic in Motia. Each Step runs a piece of code in your chosen language.
- **API Step** – A Step that exposes an HTTP endpoint and handles incoming requests.
- **Flow** – A sequence of connected Steps that execute in order.
- **State** – Persistent storage for data that Steps and Flows can read and update.
- **Event Step** – A Step that listens for and processes asynchronous events.
