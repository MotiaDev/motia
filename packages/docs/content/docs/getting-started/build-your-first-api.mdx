title: Build Your First API in Motia (TypeScript)
description: Learn how to create, connect, and extend your first API using Motia’s workflow engine in TypeScript. This guide covers key concepts, best practices, and how APIs fit into Motia’s polyglot architecture.
---

APIs are one of the core concepts of Motia because they define how your backend talks to external applications. In Motia, creating an API is just one kind of Step you can add to your workflow, but it’s a powerful starting point because you can immediately connect it to other Steps, events, and services without extra setup.

This guide will walk you through the concepts behind building your first API in Motia using TypeScript. You’ll learn what an API Step is, how requests are handled inside Motia, and how to connect your API to other parts of your backend.

If you prefer to jump straight into coding, we’ve got you covered with the interactive tutorial (a placeholder can be placed here) where you’ll build the API hands-on. Here, we’ll focus on the bigger picture:

1. Why API Steps work the way they do
2. How they interact with Flows, State, and Events
3. Tips and best practices

## Motia Concepts You’ll Use

Before we go into building your first API, let’s get familiar with the core concepts you’ll work with in Motia:

## Motia Concepts You'll Use

- **Step** – The building block of all Motia logic. Unlike traditional functions, Steps can be triggered by HTTP requests, events, or schedules.
- **API Step** – Exposes HTTP endpoints with built-in TypeScript validation and connects directly to your workflow.
- **Flow** – Groups related Steps together for visual organization and debugging in the Workbench.
- **State** – Built-in key-value storage that's automatically traced and shared across all Steps.
- **Event Step** – Handles asynchronous processing triggered by other Steps—no separate queue system needed.
