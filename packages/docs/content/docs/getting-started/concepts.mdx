# Core Concepts

Learn about the key concepts that power Motia's automation framework.

## Steps

Steps are the fundamental building blocks in Motia. Each step represents a single action or operation in your automation flow.

```typescript
export const config = {
  type: 'event',
  name: 'MyStep',
  subscribes: ['my-event'],
  emits: ['step-complete']
}

export const handler = async (input, { emit }) => {
  // Step logic here
  await emit({
    type: 'step-complete',
    data: { result: 'success' }
  })
}
```

## Events

Events are the communication mechanism between steps. Steps can:
- Subscribe to events (`subscribes`)
- Emit events (`emits`)
- React to events (via the handler)

## Flows

Flows define how steps are connected and how data flows between them. A flow can be:
- Sequential (steps run one after another)
- Parallel (steps run simultaneously)
- Conditional (steps run based on conditions)

## Handler Context

The handler context provides utilities and state management:

```typescript
export const handler = async (input, context) => {
  const { emit, log, state } = context
  // Use context utilities
}
```
