# Why Motia?

Motia is a code-first framework for building event-driven workflows without setting up complex infrastructure. Whether you're automating backend processes or chaining AI calls, Motia helps you go from idea to working system fast.

It’s simple, flexible, and built for developers who’d rather write code than configure queues and glue tools together.

## A Simpler Alternative to Durable Workflow Systems
Traditional durable workflow systems are powerful but often require complex setup. Motia gives you similar power with a simpler experience:

- No queues or brokers to manage
- Write in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, or **Python**, with more language options to come
- Visual debugging with built-in logs, traces, and flow maps
- HTTP endpoints and task scheduling with no extra config

Motia gives you robust, fault-tolerant workflows without the boilerplate.

## A Developer-Friendly Replacement for AI Frameworks
AI frameworks are often rigid and tightly scoped to language models. Motia offers a broader, more flexible foundation:

- Build workflows that include AI, APIs, and other tools
- Use the same code-first system across all kinds of flows
- Extend and customize with your own steps or components

Instead of being boxed into an AI-specific system, Motia lets you build your way, and extend as needed.
