This guide will walk you through everything you need to define a minimal **step**, set up your Motia project, and run the **Motia** dev server â€“ all in one go, using **pnpm** for package management.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Setup your project: Create a New Project Folder

Let's create a new Motia project in a dedicated folder. This is the recommended approach for keeping your projects organized.

  <Tabs items={['Automated', 'Manual']}>
<Tab value="Automated">
  <Tabs items={['npx', 'motia Global CLI']}>
    <Tab value="npx">
      Use `npx` to run the project creation command directly:

      <Tabs items={['npx']}>
        <Tab value="npx">
          ```bash
          npx motia@latest create -n <your-project-name>
          ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="motia Global CLI">
      **First, install the Motia CLI globally:**

      <Tabs items={['pnpm (Global)', 'npm (Global)', 'yarn (Global)', 'bun (Global)']}>
        <Tab value="pnpm (Global)">
          ```bash
          npm install -g motia
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="npm (Global)">
          ```bash
          npm install -g motia
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="yarn (Global)">
          ```bash
          yarn global add motia
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="bun (Global)">
          ```bash
          bun add -g motia
          ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>

      **Then, create your project using the globally installed `motia` command:**

      ```bash
      motia create -n <your-project-name>
      ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

    *   **This will**:
        *   Download and run the Motia CLI project creation tool
        *   Create a new project directory named `<your-project-name>`.
        *   Set up a basic Motia project structure inside the new folder.
        *   Install necessary dependencies using pnpm within the project folder.
        *   Add a `dev` script to your `package.json`.
        *   Include example steps to get you started.

  <Callout type="info">
    **Choosing a Project Name:** Replace `<your-project-name>` with your desired project folder name.

    **Alternative Templates:** To see other templates, run: `npx motia templates` (or `motia templates` if you installed globally).

  </Callout>

You should see a new folder created with the following files inside:

  <Files>
    <Folder name="steps" defaultOpen>
      <File name="00-noop.step.ts" />
      <File name="00-noop.step.tsx" />
      <File name="01-api.step.ts" />
      <File name="02-test-state.step.ts" />
      <File name="03-check-state-change.step.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
    <File name="types.d.ts" />
  </Files>
</Tab>
    <Tab value="Manual">
      <Callout>For these instructions we recommend using `pnpm`. For detailed installation instructions and package manager options, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) (Note: In this Quick Start, automated project creation is highly recommended).</Callout>

      **Quick Setup Summary (Manual - Advanced Users):**

      1.  **Create a project directory:**
          ```bash
          mkdir <your-project-name> && cd <your-project-name>
          ```

      2.  **Initialize `package.json`:**
          ```bash
          npm init -y
          ```

      3.  **Install Core Packages:**
          ```package-install
            motia zod
          ```

      4.  **Add `dev` Script to `package.json`:**
          ```json
          {
            "scripts": {
              "dev": "motia dev"
            }
          }
          ```

      5.  **Optional TypeScript Setup:**
          ```package-install
          ts-node typescript -D
          ```

      6.  **Create `steps` Folder:**
          ```bash
          mkdir steps
          ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Minimal Step Example

**The initial project comes with sample steps, but in this step we're going to walk you through on creating a new one**

1.  **Create a new file** named `hello-world.step.js` (or `hello-world.step.ts` for TypeScript) inside the `steps` folder.

    <Files>
      <Folder name="steps" defaultOpen>
        <File name="hello-world.step.js" />
      </Folder>
    </Files>

2.  **Paste the following code** into your `hello-world.step.js` file:

        ```javascript
        exports.config = {
          type: 'api', // "event", "api", or "cron"
          path: '/hello-world',
          method: 'GET',
          name: 'HelloWorld',
          emits: [],
          flows: ['HelloWorld'],
        }

        exports.handler = async () => {
          return {
            status: 200,
            body: { message: 'Hello World' },
          }
        }
        ```
        This minimal API step creates a **GET** endpoint on `/hello-world` that returns a JSON

        ```json
        { "message": "Hello World" }
        ```

  </Step>

   <Step>

### Start Motia Development Server & Workbench

Now, let's start Motia and see your workflow in action!

1.  **Open your terminal** in your Motia project's root directory (where your `package.json` file is located).

2.  **Run the development server command:** Use the `dev` script that was set up in your `package.json`:

    <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
      <Tab value="yarn">```yarn run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="npm">```npm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">```pnpm run dev ```</Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">```bun run dev ```</Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Motia will:

    - **Scan** your `steps` folder for step definition files (`.step.ts`, `.step.js`, `.step.py`, `.step.rb`).
    - **Register** your Steps with the Motia runtime.
    - **Launch** a development server and the Motia Workbench UI (typically at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)).

    <Callout type="info">
      **Changing the Port:** To run the Workbench on a different port, use the `--port` option: `pnpm run dev --port
      3001`
    </Callout>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### View your Flow in the Workbench

    1.  **Open your browser** and navigate to the Motia Workbench.  By default, it's running at:  [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) or [`http://127.0.0.1:3000`](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

    2.  **Locate your Flow in the Sidebar:** On the left sidebar of the Workbench UI, you should see a list of Flows.

        *   **For the default template:**  You'll find a flow named "**default**".
        *   **For the `hello-world.step.js` example:** You'll find a flow named "**HelloWorld**".

    3.  **Select your Flow:** Click on the flow name in the sidebar.

    4.  **Observe the Visual Flow:** You should now see a visual representation of your flow in the main panel. This is the Motia Workbench visualizing the steps and event flow within your application!

        ![Flow Visualization in Workbench](./../img/hello-world-workbench.png)

        <Callout type="info">
            You can click and drag the nodes in the visual editor to rearrange them for better clarity. Explore the UI to familiarize yourself with the Workbench!
        </Callout>

    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Test your step

    Now you created the step `hello-world.js`, which creates a **GET** `/hello-world` endpoint, you can test by either opening http://localhost:3000/hello-world or

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/hello-world
    ```

    This is a really simple example where you can have your first step running.

    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Understanding a flow with events

    Now you already created an API Steps, let's check the flow that's already in the project, click on `default` flow on Workbench sidebar on the left. (Or navigate to http://localhost:3000/flow/default)

    You should see the page below

    ![Flow Visualization in Workbench](./../img/getting-started-workbench.png)

    This flow is a little bit more advanced, it has Noop steps (which we are going to talk about later), API steps, and Event steps.

    Event steps are code that can take some time to finish and can have errors (like LLM calls which are non-deterministic), in case they fail, they can rerun later.

    In the flow represented by the image above you should see a node with a button to start it, go ahead an click it and check the logs that are generated.

    Now let's dive deep on the flow you already executed. Let's jump in to [Core concepts](/docs/getting-started/core-concepts)
