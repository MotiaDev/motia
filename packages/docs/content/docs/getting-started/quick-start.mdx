title: Quick Start
description: Get up and running with a new Motia project in just a few seconds.
---
<Steps>

<Step>
### 1. Create Your Project

Use `npx` to create a new Motia project. This single command will scaffold a new application and install all necessary dependencies.

```bash
npx motia@latest create
```

The installer will guide you through a few questions to set up your project. Once it's done, you will have a new project directory ready to go.

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Start the Development Server

Navigate into your new project directory and start the Motia development server.

```bash
cd <your-project-name> # If you've created a new folder for the project, navigate into it

npx motia dev
```

<Callout>
The `create` command uses `npm` by default. If you chose a different package manager during setup, use `pnpm dev`, `yarn dev`, or `bun dev`.
</Callout>

This command starts the Motia runtime and the Workbench, a powerful UI for developing and debugging your workflows. By default, it's available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Run Your First Flow

The starter project comes with a pre-built `basic-tutorial` flow. Let's run it.

1.  **Open the Workbench** in your browser at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
2.  **Click the  the `Tutorial`** button on the top right of the workbnech.
3.  **Complete the  the `Tutorial`** to get an understanding of the basica of Motia and using the Workbench.
