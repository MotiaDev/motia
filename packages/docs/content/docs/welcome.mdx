# Welcome to Motia

Motia is a powerful framework for building event-driven workflows. It provides simple, composable building blocks called **Steps** that handle your business logic while Motia manages the infrastructure.

## Why Motia?

Motia is designed to help developers create robust and scalable applications with ease. Here are some key benefits of using Motia:

- üöÄ **Zero Infrastructure Setup** - No message queues or event brokers to configure
- üîå **Plug-and-Play Steps** - Write code in your favorite language (JS, TS, Python, Ruby)
- üìä **Built-in Observability** - Real-time logs, traces, and flow visualization
- ‚ö° **Built-in API & Scheduling** - Out of the box support for HTTP endpoints and scheduled tasks

## Workbench

Motia Workbench is a powerful development platform that serves as your control center for building and debugging flows. It provides:

- **Flow Visualization** - Interactive diagrams showing your entire workflow
- **Real-time Testing** - Test endpoints and monitor event flow directly in the UI
- **Live Logging** - Monitor execution with detailed, real-time logs
- **Development Tools** - Hot reloading, error handling, and state inspection

### Custom Visualization

Workbench supports two types of custom step visualizations:

- **NOOP Steps** - Represent external processes, webhooks, and human interactions
- **UI Steps** - Create custom visual components for any step type using React
