title: Adapters (Removed)
description: Adapters configuration has been removed from motia
---

<Callout type="error">
**Adapters have been removed from motia.** The adapters configuration that was previously available in `motia.config.ts` is no longer supported.
</Callout>

## What Changed

In previous versions, you could configure adapters for state, streams, events, and cron in `motia.config.ts`. This configuration has been removed as part of the migration to `iii config.yml`.

The framework now handles infrastructure configuration internally. You no longer need to manually configure adapters for:

- **State** - Key-value storage
- **Streams** - Real-time data
- **Events** - Event queues
- **Cron** - Job locking

## Migration

If you were previously using custom adapters, remove the `adapters` configuration from your project. The framework will use its built-in defaults.

**Before (removed):**
```typescript
import { config } from '@motiadev/core'
import { RedisStateAdapter } from '@motiadev/adapter-redis-state'

export default config({
  adapters: {
    state: new RedisStateAdapter({ url: redisUrl })
  }
})
```

**After:**

Configuration is handled via `config.yml`. See [iii Configuration](/docs/development-guide/motia-config) for details.
