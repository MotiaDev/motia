# Motia Workbench

Motia Workbench is a development platform that helps you build and debug your Motia flows. It serves as your control center where you can:

- Visualize flows as interactive diagrams
- Test steps directly in the UI
- Monitor real-time logs
- Debug issues

## Getting Started

Start workbench by running:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">```pnpm run dev ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">```yarn run dev ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">```npm run dev ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">```bun run dev ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
  Running the dev command starts:
  - **Motia Server**: Backend services and API endpoints
  - **Motia Workbench**: Web interface at http://localhost:3000
  - **Development Mode**: Auto-reloads when changes are made
</Callout>

## Key Features

<Steps>
  <Step>
    
  ### Flow Visualization
  See your entire flow as an interactive diagram:
  - Steps appear as connected nodes
  - API endpoints are highlighted as entry points
  - Event connections show data flow
  - Click any step to see its details
  </Step>

  <Step>
  
  ### Real-time Testing 
  Test your flows directly in the interface: 
  - Send test requests to API endpoints 
  - Monitor how events flow through steps 
  - Visualize step sequence execution 
  - Inspect data at each stage
  </Step>

  <Step>
  
  ### Live Logs 
  Monitor your flow execution in real-time with structured logging and trace information.
  </Step>

  <Step>
   
  ### Development Tools
  - **Hot Reload**: Changes reflect immediately in the UI
  - **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with contextual debugging information
  - **State Inspector**: Real-time monitoring of state management
