## Can I deploy any Motia app to Motia Cloud?

Node.JS projects are fully supported. Python projects are supported as well but there are a few external libraries that are not currently supported, such as:

- TensorFlow
- Pytorch

These are not supported due to the limited bundle size of 100MB.

Be mindful that static or binary files added to the bundle must not exceed 100MB.

## What happens when I deploy my project to Motia Cloud?

When you deploy for the first time, it's immediately available. But when you deploy 
for the second time and beyond, the deployment is listed but needs to be manually promoted to be live.

Promoting a deployment is a really simple process and happens immediately after you click.
Check the [Promote](/docs/concepts/deployment/motia-cloud/features#instant-rollbacks-and-roll-ups-updates) page for more information.

## I deployed a new version but it didn't update

It's because Motia Cloud doesn't automatically promote the new version to be live. You need to promote it manually.
Check the [Promote](/docs/concepts/deployment/motia-cloud/features#instant-rollbacks-and-roll-ups-updates) page for more information.

## How do I deploy my project to Motia Cloud?

You can deploy your project to Motia Cloud by using the Motia CLI or through the web interface.
Check the [Deployment](/docs/concepts/deployment/motia-cloud/deployment) page for more information.

## How do I rollback to a previous deployment?

You can rollback to a previous deployment by clicking the rollback button in the Motia Cloud web interface.
Check the [Promote](/docs/concepts/deployment/motia-cloud/features#instant-rollbacks-and-roll-ups-updates) page for more information.

## How do I promote a deployment to be live?

You can promote a deployment to be live by clicking the promote button in the Motia Cloud web interface.
Check the [Promote](/docs/concepts/deployment/motia-cloud/features#instant-rollbacks-and-roll-ups-updates) page for more information.

## How do I delete a deployment?

You can delete a deployment by clicking the delete button in the Motia Cloud web interface.

## How do I update environment variables?

Currently, the only way to update environment variables is by creating a new deployment.
The reason is that every deployment is an atomic deployment and Environment Variables can also be source of
issues.

This was a decision to make sure that deployments are always predictable and consistent. And rollbacks 
can be done with confidence. If an environment variable updated caused an issue, you can quickly rollback to 
a previous deployment.

## How do I add static or binary files to my project?

You can add static files to your project by adding them to the `includeFiles` property in the step config.
Check the [Deployment](/docs/concepts/deployment/motia-cloud/deployment#adding-static-files-to-the-bundle) page for more information.

## Is it possible to deploy using GitHub Actions?

Yes, it's totally possible to deploy your project using GitHub Actions.

## How much it cost?

We're still working on the pricing model, but it's going to be based on usage. You will pay for what you use.

## How do I get support?

You can get support by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MotiaDev/motia-cloud-support/issues).
