These can also be used to also test your flows from the flow visualization tool in Workbench.<br/><br/> ðŸ’¡ You can override a step's laout by creating a UI step, read more here (link to docs).`,

The attributes specific to a NOOP step are virtualEmits and virtualSubscribes, these are similar to emits and subscribes with the exception that they are not handled internally by Motia, their definitions are simply for visualization purposes to indicate how they connect with other steps. virtualEmits  i.e.: /some-api-step-path`,
