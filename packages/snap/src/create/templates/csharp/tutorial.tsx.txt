        Motia is an all-in-one framework for modern backend systems. Out of the box support for API endpoints,
        background jobs, scheduled tasks and agentic workflow orchestration through a unified runtime.
        <br />
        <br />
        This template showcases <b>C# Steps</b>, allowing you to write backend logic using C# and .NET 9.

        This API Step is written in <b>C#</b>! It exposes an HTTP endpoint just like TypeScript or Python steps.

        <br />
        C# steps use static classes for configuration and handlers, providing strong typing and performance.

      <p>
        C# steps consist of two static classes: one for <b>Config</b> and one for <b>Handler</b>.
        <br />
        <br />
        The config uses an anonymous object to define step properties like type, name, path, and method.
        <br />
        <br />
        The handler is an async method that receives the request and context (dynamic) as parameters.

        <br />
        <br />
        The handler receives the event data as the first parameter and context as the second.
