// 1. Woah did you see that? You just executed your first
// function in multiple languages!

// 2. This is an example of a TypeScript step.
// Every step is composed of a config, and a handler function.
import type { Handlers } from "@motiadev/core";
import type { EventConfig } from "motia";
import * as z from "zod";

// 3. This is a config object, every Step has one.
//    Configs tell Motia how a Step is triggered,
//    what events it emits, and what flows it's part of
//
//    There are many configuration options available:
//
//    ApiRouteConfig = Create routes that trigger your step
//    EventConfig = Have specific events trigger your step
//    CronConfig = Have specific times trigger your step
export const config: EventConfig = {
  // 4. While configs vary a little bit each one has a type,
  // a name, a type, some definition of what triggers it,
  // what its input schema is, and what events it might emit.
  type: "event",
  name: "HelloFromTypeScript",
  // 5. When a 'hello' event occurs the handler defined below will run.
  subscribes: ["hello"],
  input: z.object({ extra: z.string() }),
  emits: ["hello.response.typescript"],

  // 6. These fields are optional but the flow field is very useful
  // for visual organization inside this Workbench.
  // If you have a series of Steps that all complete one big task or workflow
  // then adding them to the same flow makes visualizing them in Workbench easier.
  description: "Says hello in the logs",
  flows: ["hello"],
  virtualEmits: [],
  virtualSubscribes: [],
};

// 7. This is a handler, it's the code that will run when the conditions
// defined in the config are met. Every handler gets a payload and
// a context that contains useful functions to emit events, create logs,
// modify state, and other useful things.
export const handler: Handlers["HelloFromTypeScript"] = async (
  payload,
  { emit, logger, state }
) => {
  logger.info("Hello from TypeScript!");
};
