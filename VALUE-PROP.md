# Value Prop

Wistro is a developer-first, event-driven framework that scales with your needs - from simple automation to complex distributed flows. It lets you focus purely on flow logic while it handles orchestrating across multiple endpoints, languages, and platforms - providing a unified, type-safe interface with real-time visualization and testing.

## Pain Points It Solves:

- Developer-First Framework: Wistro provides a rigorous, convention-based framework that developers love. Start simple with basic flows that are up and running in minutes, then seamlessly scale to more sophisticated scenarios as your needs grow. Its carefully crafted guardrails and patterns dramatically speed up development while ensuring consistency and reliability across flows of any complexity. Whether you're building a simple approval flow or orchestrating complex distributed systems, you get the perfect balance of flexibility and structure.

- Language & Runtime Freedom: Workflow components can be written in any language and run anywhere from laptops and phones to IoT devices and servers. Just install the lightweight Wistro endpoint and it handles everything else - deployment, versioning, updates, runtime management, and secure inbound/outbound traffic management. Whether you're running Node.js microservices, Python data processing, mobile apps, IoT firmware, or cloud functions, Wistro's lightweight event-based protocol means anything that can send and receive events can be part of your workflow. No complex setup, infrastructure management, or security configuration required - Wistro takes care of the operational complexity so you can focus on your workflow logic.

- Event-Driven Simplicity: Rather than forcing complex RPC or REST patterns, Wistro uses simple event-based communication with clear conventions. Components listen for events they care about and emit events when they do something, making it easy to build loosely coupled, resilient flows while maintaining predictability.

- Human & External System Integration: Because Wistro is message-based, flows can naturally pause for human approval, external system processing, or long-running operations. When the response comes back - whether it's a manager's approval, a third-party API callback, or a webhook from another system - the flow simply picks up exactly where it left off. This makes it trivial to build flows that span human decision points, external services, and time delays without complex state management.
