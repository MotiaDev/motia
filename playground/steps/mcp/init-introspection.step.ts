 * Initialization endpoint for MCP introspection service

 * NOTE: This step is a placeholder for initializing the introspection service
 * with LockedData. In the current Motia architecture, step handlers don't have
 * direct access to LockedData.
 * 
 * Full introspection functionality requires either:
 * 1. A Motia plugin that injects LockedData into the introspection service
 * 2. Core framework changes to expose LockedData to steps
 * 3. Using alternative methods to access step/flow information
 * 
 * For now, the MCP server will work with limited introspection capabilities.
